  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage guidelines

### File format support

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define supported formats clearly">
    Always specify which file types are accepted. Display this information prominently in the upload area.

    <Check>
      Example: "Supported formats: .xlsx, .csv, .xml"
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate files on selection">
    Perform client-side validation immediately when files are selected to provide quick feedback before upload attempts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set reasonable file size limits">
    Implement and communicate file size restrictions to prevent failed uploads and server issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Interaction patterns

**Drag and Drop Guidelines:**

- Provide clear visual feedback when files are dragged over the drop zone
- Support multiple file selection when appropriate for your use case
- Highlight the drop area with border changes or color shifts during drag operations

**Browse Button Best Practices:**

- Use clear, action-oriented button text like "Browse" or "Select Files"
- Ensure the button is accessible and works with keyboard navigation
- Consider allowing both single and multiple file selection based on requirements

<Warning>
  Always validate uploaded files on both client and server sides for security and data integrity.
</Warning>

### Progress and feedback

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Processing Feedback" icon="clock">
    Show clear progress indicators during upload operations. Include file names and status messages to keep users informed.

    **Best practices:**
    - Display file names being processed
    - Use loading animations or progress bars
    - Prevent interface interaction during upload
  </Card>
  <Card title="Error Handling" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    Provide specific, actionable error messages that help users understand and resolve issues.

    **Best practices:**
    - Explain why the upload failed
    - Suggest corrective actions
    - Allow users to retry easily
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best practices

<Check>
  **Do** provide immediate visual feedback for all user interactions (drag, drop, select)
</Check>

<Check>
  **Do** clearly communicate file format restrictions and size limits upfront
</Check>

<Check>
  **Do** show upload progress and file names during processing
</Check>

<Check>
  **Do** allow users to remove uploaded files before final submission
</Check>

<Check>
  **Do** provide specific error messages when uploads fail
</Check>

<Warning>
  **Don't** allow uploads to start without proper validation
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Don't** leave users guessing about upload progress or status
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Don't** use generic error messages that don't help users resolve issues
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Don't** forget to handle edge cases like network interruptions or large files
</Warning>

## Common use cases

### Data Import

Perfect for importing structured data like Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, or XML documents into business applications.

**Implementation considerations:**
- Validate data format and structure after upload
- Provide data preview or validation summary
- Handle large datasets gracefully
- Offer data mapping or column selection interfaces

### Document Attachments

Enable users to attach supporting documents, images, or files to records or forms.

**Implementation considerations:**
- Support multiple file types (documents, images, PDFs)
- Display file thumbnails or icons based on type
- Provide file management capabilities (rename, replace, remove)
- Handle file versioning if needed

### Batch Operations

Allow users to upload multiple files simultaneously for bulk processing operations.

**Implementation considerations:**
- Show individual file progress and status
- Handle partial failures gracefully
- Provide batch operation controls (pause, resume, cancel)
- Summarize overall operation results

## Contextual Integration

### Excel Import Example

In workflows like inventory management, the File Uploader can seamlessly transition from upload to data preview:

1. **Upload**: User drags Excel file to upload area
2. **Processing**: Shows "Uploading inventory-data.xlsx..." with loader
3. **Preview**: Instead of just showing the uploaded file, display a preview of imported items, validation results, or data mapping interface
4. **Action**: User can proceed with import or make adjustments

<Tip>
  This contextual approach keeps users focused on their workflow rather than just the file upload mechanics.
</Tip>

## Accessibility considerations

- **Keyboard navigation**: Ensure the upload area and buttons are accessible via keyboard using Tab and Enter/Space keys
- **Screen reader support**: 
  - Provide clear labels and instructions for screen readers
  - Announce upload progress and status changes
  - Use aria-live regions for dynamic status updates
- **Focus management**: Maintain logical focus flow throughout the upload process
- **Touch targets**: Ensure adequate touch target sizes (minimum 44x44px) for mobile interfaces
- **Color independence**: Don't rely solely on color to indicate upload states or errors
- **File type communication**: Clearly communicate supported file types in text, not just visually

<Check>
  Test the component with keyboard navigation, screen readers, and various assistive technologies to ensure full accessibility.
</Check>

## Writing effective upload instructions

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="✓ Be specific about file requirements" icon="check">
    Clearly state supported file types, size limits, and any special requirements.

    **Good**: "Upload Excel files (.xlsx) up to 10MB"
    **Bad**: "Upload your file here"
  </Card>
  <Card title="✓ Use action-oriented language" icon="check">
    Make instructions clear and actionable for users.

    **Good**: "DROP A FILE TO UPLOAD OR BROWSE"
    **Bad**: "File upload area"
  </Card>
  <Card title="✓ Provide helpful error messages" icon="check">
    When uploads fail, explain what happened and how to fix it.

    **Good**: "File size exceeds 10MB limit. Please compress your file or contact support."
    **Bad**: "Upload failed."
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Implementation notes

<Info>
  For implementation details, code examples, and framework-specific guidance, refer to your design system's component library documentation.
</Info>

### Required functionality

When implementing the File Uploader, ensure you support:

1. **Drag and drop handling**: File drag events and drop zone highlighting
2. **File input integration**: Hidden file input triggered by browse button
3. **Upload progress tracking**: Real-time progress indication during uploads
4. **Validation logic**: Client-side and server-side file validation
5. **Error handling**: Graceful error display and recovery options
6. **State management**: Proper state transitions between upload phases

### Security considerations

```javascript
// Example validation patterns
const validateFile = (file) => {
  // Check file type
  const allowedTypes = ['application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet'];
  if (!allowedTypes.includes(file.type)) {
    return 'Invalid file type. Please upload an Excel file (.xlsx)';
  }
  
  // Check file size (10MB limit)
  const maxSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024;
  if (file.size > maxSize) {
    return 'File too large. Maximum size is 10MB.';
  }
  
  return null; // Valid file
};
```

<Warning>
  Always perform server-side validation in addition to client-side checks for security and data integrity.
</Warning>
