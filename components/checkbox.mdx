## Overview

Checkboxes allow users to select one or multiple items from a list of individual items. They are designed for multiple choices, where each checkbox works independently from others in the list.

</Frame>

## When to use

Use checkboxes when you need to:

- **Enable multiple selections** from a list of options (0, 1, or many items)
- **Provide independent choices** where selections don't affect other options
- **Toggle settings** on and off in forms or preference panels
- **Create parent-child relationships** with hierarchical selections
- **Filter content** by allowing users to select multiple filter criteria

<Tip>
  Checkboxes work independently—checking one box doesn't affect any other selections in the list. For mutually exclusive options, use radio buttons instead.
</Tip>

## tl;dr

### General usage

Checkboxes are used for multiple choices, not for mutually exclusive choices. Each checkbox works independently from other checkboxes in the list, therefore checking an additional box does not affect any other selections.

When there are multiple items to select in a list, users can select zero, one, or any number of items.

### Checkbox group

Use a checkbox group when the user can make one or many selections from 2-8 options.

<Warning>
  For lists with more than 8 options, consider using a different pattern like a multi-select dropdown or filter panel.
</Warning>

## Variants

### State

The Checkbox features three states that provide clear visual feedback for user selections.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Selected">
    The selected state signifies a positive choice. The checkbox displays a checkmark icon with the primary color background, clearly indicating the option has been chosen.

    **Visual indicator**: Blue background with white checkmark

    **When to use**: When an option is actively selected by the user
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Unselected">
    The unselected state indicates the option is not chosen. The checkbox appears as an empty box with a border, ready to be selected.

    **Visual indicator**: White background with gray border

    **When to use**: Default state for options that haven't been selected
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mixed (Indeterminate)">
    The mixed state is used for checkboxes representing a combination of selected and unselected choices. This offers a versatile visual representation for parent checkboxes when only some child items are selected.

    **Visual indicator**: Blue background with minus/dash icon

    **When to use**: Parent checkboxes with partial child selection
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  The indeterminate (mixed) state is particularly useful for hierarchical lists where a parent checkbox controls multiple child checkboxes.
</Info>

## Usage guidelines

### When to use a standalone checkbox

Standalone checkboxes should be used in situations where the context is clear without an associated text label.

<Check>
  **Use standalone checkboxes when** the checkbox is connected to other controls inside a panel and the context is obvious from the surrounding interface.
</Check>

**Example use cases:**

- Table row selection in the first column
- Bulk selection controls in toolbars
- Settings toggles with clear nearby labels

### Checkbox or radio button?

<Warning>
  Do not use checkboxes for single-select options. Checkboxes and radio buttons cannot be used interchangeably.
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Checkboxes" icon="square-check">
    - Multiple selections allowed
    - Independent choices
    - Select 0, 1, or many options
    - Non-mutually exclusive options
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Radio Buttons" icon="circle-dot">
    - Single selection only
    - Mutually exclusive choices
    - Must select exactly one option
    - One option from a defined list
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Decision flowchart:**

1. Can users select more than one option? → **Yes** = Checkbox
2. Are options mutually exclusive? → **Yes** = Radio button
3. Can users deselect all options? → **Yes** = Checkbox

## Best practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use clear, concise labels">
    Ensure checkbox labels clearly describe what will happen when the option is selected. Keep labels short and action-oriented.

    <Check>
      Good: "Send me email notifications"
    </Check>
    <Warning>
      Avoid: "Notifications" (too vague)
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Maintain consistent selection behavior">
    All checkboxes in a group should work independently. Selecting one checkbox should never automatically select or deselect another (except in parent-child relationships).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide feedback for actions">
    Use the checkbox state to provide immediate visual feedback. Don't rely on external confirmations for simple checkbox interactions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Group related options">
    When presenting multiple checkboxes, group related options together with clear section headings to improve scannability.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common use cases

### Forms

Use checkboxes in forms to collect multiple preferences or consent options.

**Examples:**

- Newsletter subscription preferences
- Feature opt-ins
- Privacy settings
- Marketing consent checkboxes

<Tip>
  Always make it clear what users are agreeing to when they check a box, especially for legal or privacy-related options.
</Tip>

### Filters

For selecting and applying multiple elements of the same filter category.

**Examples:**

- Product category filters in e-commerce
- Date range selectors
- Status filters (Active, Pending, Completed)
- Tag or label filters

**Best practice**: Show the count of selected filters and provide a "Clear all" option for better user experience.

### Terms and conditions

Using a checkbox to enable a button to complete an action.

**Implementation pattern:**

1. Present terms and conditions or agreement text
2. Require checkbox selection to enable submit button
3. Disable action button until checkbox is checked

<Warning>
  Ensure checkbox labels for legal agreements are clear and specific. Avoid generic labels like "I agree."
</Warning>

### Lists with sub-selections

They are used when there is a parent and child relationship. You can use a parent checkbox to make a bulk selection of all list items. Unchecking the parent deselects all of the list items.

**How it works:**

- **All children selected** → Parent shows selected state
- **No children selected** → Parent shows unselected state
- **Some children selected** → Parent shows mixed (indeterminate) state
- **Click parent when mixed** → Selects all children

Alternatively, you can select children individually when the parent is not selected, which is where the indeterminate state comes into play.

<Tip>
  The indeterminate state provides crucial visual feedback in hierarchical selections, helping users understand the current selection status at a glance.
</Tip>

## Accessibility considerations

- **Keyboard navigation**: Ensure checkboxes can be toggled using Space key
- **Focus indicators**: Provide clear focus states for keyboard users
- **Touch targets**: Maintain minimum 44x44px touch target for mobile
- **Label association**: Always associate labels with checkboxes using proper HTML structure
- **Screen reader support**:
  - Announce checkbox state (checked/unchecked/mixed)
  - Provide clear, descriptive labels
  - Group related checkboxes with fieldset and legend elements
- **Color independence**: Don't rely solely on color to indicate state
- **ARIA attributes**: Use `aria-checked` with "true", "false", or "mixed" values

<Check>
  Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers to ensure full accessibility compliance.
</Check>

## Writing effective checkbox labels

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="✓ Be specific and clear" icon="check">
    Labels should clearly state what happens when the checkbox is selected.

    **Good**: "Send me weekly email updates"

    **Bad**: "Updates"
  </Card>
  <Card title="✓ Use positive phrasing" icon="check">
    Frame labels in positive terms rather than negative.

    **Good**: "Show advanced options"

    **Avoid**: "Don't hide advanced options"
  </Card>
  <Card title="✓ Keep labels concise" icon="check">
    Aim for labels that are scannable and easy to understand at a glance.

    **Target**: 1-5 words per label when possible
  </Card>
  <Card title="✓ Provide context when needed" icon="check">
    If the checkbox choice isn't immediately clear, add helper text below the label.

    **Example**:

    - Label: "Enable two-factor authentication"
    - Helper: "Adds an extra layer of security to your account"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### States to implement

When implementing the checkbox component, ensure you support all three states:

1. **Unselected** (default): `checked={false}`
2. **Selected**: `checked={true}`
3. **Indeterminate**: `indeterminate={true}` (typically set via JavaScript)

### Event handling

```javascript
// Example event handler pattern
handleCheckboxChange(event) {
  const isChecked = event.target.checked;
  // Update state accordingly
}
```
