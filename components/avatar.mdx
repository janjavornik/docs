</Check>

### Initials Display

In instances where a user hasn't uploaded a profile picture, the Avatar component intelligently generates and displays the user's initials. This ensures a consistent and identifiable representation for every user.

**How it works:**

- Extracts first letter of first name and last name
- Displays initials in a colored circle
- Maintains visual consistency across the interface
- Provides fallback when images fail to load

<Info>
  The initials fallback ensures every user has a unique, identifiable avatar even without uploading a photo.

## Common use cases

### User profile sections

Display larger avatars in profile headers, account settings, and user detail pages.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Profile Header" icon="user">
    Use large or extra-large avatars at the top of profile pages to establish user identity immediately.

    **Recommended size**: 64x64px or larger
  </Card>
  <Card title="Account Settings" icon="gear">
    Show current user's avatar with upload/change functionality in settings interfaces.

    **Recommended size**: 48x48px to 64x64px
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Navigation and headers

Include user avatars in application headers or navigation areas to personalize the interface.

**Best practices:**

- Place in top-right corner for consistency with common patterns
- Include dropdown menu triggered by clicking the avatar
- Show online/offline status with a small badge indicator
- Provide quick access to profile and account settings

### Lists and tables

Use small avatars to identify users in lists, tables, or data grids.

**Implementation tips:**

- Keep avatars small (24-32px) to avoid overwhelming the layout
- Align avatars consistently (usually left-aligned)
- Include user name as text alongside the avatar
- Consider using avatar groups for multiple users

### Comments and activity feeds

Display avatars next to user-generated content like comments, posts, or activities.

**Pattern:**

```
[Avatar] [Username]
         [Content/Comment]
         [Timestamp]
```

**Recommended size**: 32x32px or 40x40px

### Collaboration indicators

Show who is currently viewing, editing, or has access to shared resources.

<Tip>
  Use stacked or overlapping avatars to show multiple collaborators without taking too much space.
</Tip>

**Examples:**

- Real-time document editors (Google Docs style)
- Active viewers in dashboards
- Team members with access to a resource
- Participants in a meeting or call

### Team and member directories

Create visual rosters showing all team members or project participants.

**Grid layouts work well for:**

- Team pages
- Department directories
- Project member lists
- Organizational charts

## Avatar groups

When displaying multiple users, use avatar groups with proper stacking and overflow handling.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stack avatars with overlap">
    Overlap avatars slightly (typically 8-12px) to create a compact group while maintaining visibility.

    <Check>
      Maintain consistent z-index ordering (left to right or most recent on top)
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Limit visible avatars">
    Show 3-5 avatars maximum, then display overflow count (e.g., "+5 more")

    **Example**: Show first 4 avatars + "+12" indicator
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide tooltips">
    On hover, show names of users in the stack for accessibility and clarity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle interactions">
    Clicking the group should reveal all members in a modal or expanded view.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Status indicators and badges

Enhance avatars with status badges to convey additional information.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Online/Offline Status">
    Add a small colored dot (typically 8-12px) to indicate user presence:

    - **Green**: Online/Active
    - **Yellow/Orange**: Away/Idle
    - **Red**: Busy/Do Not Disturb
    - **Gray**: Offline

    **Position**: Bottom-right corner of the avatar
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Role Badges">
    Display user roles or permissions with icon badges:

    - **Crown**: Admin or Owner
    - **Star**: Premium or Featured user
    - **Shield**: Moderator
    - **Check**: Verified user

    **Position**: Top-right or bottom-right corner
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Notification Counts">
    Show unread message counts or pending actions:

    - Small circular badge with number
    - Red background for attention
    - Position at top-right corner

    <Warning>
      Don't combine too many badges on a single avatar—limit to one or two for clarity.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Accessibility considerations

<Check>
  **Always provide alternative text** describing the user (e.g., "Profile picture of Jane Doe")
</Check>

<Check>
  **Ensure sufficient color contrast** between initials and background (minimum 4.5:1 ratio)
</Check>

<Check>
  **Make avatars keyboard accessible** when they trigger actions or navigation
</Check>

<Check>
  **Announce status changes** to screen readers when presence indicators update
</Check>

### Implementation guidelines

- Use semantic HTML with proper `alt` attributes for images
- Provide `aria-label` for interactive avatars
- Include user name in tooltip on hover
- Don't rely solely on color to convey status information
- Ensure touch targets meet minimum size requirements (44x44px)
- Test with screen readers to verify proper announcements

<Tip>
  For initials-based avatars, screen readers should announce the full name, not just the initials.
</Tip>

## Best practices

### Image optimization

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="✓ Use appropriate image formats" icon="image">
    Prefer WebP with JPEG fallback for photos. Use SVG for icon-based avatars.
  </Card>
  <Card title="✓ Implement lazy loading" icon="rocket">
    Load avatar images only when they enter the viewport, especially in long lists.
  </Card>
  <Card title="✓ Provide multiple resolutions" icon="layer-group">
    Serve different image sizes based on display context and device pixel ratio.
  </Card>
  <Card title="✓ Set width and height attributes" icon="ruler">
    Prevent layout shift by specifying dimensions before images load.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Initials generation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Extract meaningful initials">
    Use first letter of first and last name. If only one name, use first two letters.

    **Examples**:

    - "Jane Doe" → "JD"
    - "Madonna" → "MA"
    - "李明 (Li Ming)" → "LM"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle edge cases">
    - Empty names → Use generic icon or question mark
    - Special characters → Remove or normalize
    - Very long names → Limit to 2-3 characters max
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply consistent styling">
    Uppercase initials, center alignment, and readable font size (typically 40-50% of avatar size).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Color assignment for initials

Assign consistent background colors based on user attributes for better recognition:

**Methods:**

- **Hash-based**: Generate color from user ID or name hash
- **Sequential**: Assign colors from a predefined palette rotation
- **Semantic**: Use colors based on user role or department

<Info>
  Ensure your color palette has sufficient variety (8-12 colors) and all colors meet accessibility standards.
</Info>

### Visual properties

- **Shape**: Circular (primary) or rounded square (8px radius)
- **Border**: Optional 1-2px border with subtle color
- **Shadow**: Optional subtle shadow for depth
- **Background** (for initials): Use brand-aligned color palette
- **Text color** (for initials): Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1)

## Common pitfalls to avoid

<Warning>
  **Don't use tiny avatars for primary identification** — Users should be able to recognize avatars at a glance
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Don't forget fallbacks** — Always handle missing images gracefully with initials or default icons
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Don't ignore loading states** — Show skeleton loaders or placeholders while images load
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Don't overcrowd with badges** — Limit overlay elements to maintain clarity
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Don't use random colors without consistency** — Use deterministic color assignment so the same user always gets the same color
</Warning>
