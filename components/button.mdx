## Overview

Buttons allow users to perform an action or navigate to another page. They have multiple styles for various needs and are ideal for calling attention to where a user needs to do something in order to move forward in a flow.

</Frame>

## When to use

Use buttons to help users:

- **Complete primary actions** such as submitting forms or confirming decisions
- **Navigate to different pages** or sections of your application
- **Trigger important operations** that require user confirmation
- **Initiate workflows** that move users forward in a process

<Tip>
  Buttons are most effective when they clearly communicate what will happen when clicked. Use action-oriented language like "Submit", "Add Filter", or "Save Changes".
</Tip>

## Variants

### Size

The button component comes in two sizes to accommodate different layout requirements.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Large">
    The large size is the default and most frequently used option. Use large buttons for:

    - Primary page actions
    - Form submissions
    - Modal confirmations

    **Minimum width**: 72px
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Small">
    Use small buttons in compact interfaces or when multiple actions are grouped together.

    **Minimum width**: 64px
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Style

Choose the appropriate button style based on the action's importance in your interface hierarchy.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Primary" icon="star">
    Use for the most important action on a page or section. Primary buttons demand attention and guide users toward the main task.

    **Best for**: Form submissions, main CTAs, confirmations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Solid" icon="square">
    Choose solid style for secondary functions that support your main objectives but have lower emphasis than primary actions.

    **Best for**: Secondary actions, supporting tasks
  </Card>
  <Card title="Outline" icon="border-outer">
    Use for tertiary actions with the lowest hierarchy, such as "Cancel" or "Previous Step". Also suitable for hover and edit modes on grey backgrounds.

    **Best for**: Cancel actions, navigation steps, low-priority tasks
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI" icon="sparkles">
    Special style to mark AI-generated content or AI-powered features.

    **Best for**: AI features, generated content markers
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Label and icon

Buttons can contain labels, icons, or both depending on the context and clarity requirements.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="With label and icon">
    Combine labels with icons when the icon has a strong association with the action and adds clarity.

    ```jsx
    <Button icon="sync" label="Refresh Data" />
    ```

    <Check>
      Icons enhance understanding and make buttons more scannable in dense interfaces.
    </Check>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Icon only">
    Use icon-only buttons for frequently recurring actions where icons are self-explanatory (e.g., edit, delete, close).

    ```jsx
    <Button icon="sync" tooltip="Refresh" />
    ```

    <Warning>
      Always include a tooltip for icon-only buttons to ensure accessibility and clarity.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Label only">
    Use text-only buttons when the action is best described with words and an icon would add no value.

    ```jsx
    <Button label="Submit Form" />
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Behavior states

Buttons respond to user interaction with visual feedback through different states.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Default">
    The standard appearance of the button, presenting its regular design without any user interaction.

    This is the resting state users see before taking action.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hover">
    When users hover their cursor over the button, it transitions into the hover state. This state provides visual feedback, indicating that the button is interactive.

    **Purpose**: Communicates interactivity and prepares users for the click action.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pressed">
    As users click or tap on the button, it enters the pressed state. This state acknowledges the user's action, letting them know that their input has been registered.

    **Purpose**: Provides immediate visual confirmation of user interaction.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Disabled">
    In the disabled state, the button appears visually grayed out or faded, indicating that it's temporarily inactive or unavailable for interaction.

    **When to use**: Prevent unintended actions and guide users when certain conditions must be met before the button becomes clickable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Loading">
    Shows a loading indicator when an action is processing. This prevents duplicate submissions and informs users that their action is being processed.

    **Purpose**: Provides feedback during asynchronous operations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  The Button and SplitButton components share the same variants for consistency across your interface.

## Usage guidelines

### General usage principles

<Steps>
  <Step title="One primary CTA per page or section">
    Limit primary buttons to one per page or distinct section to maintain clear visual hierarchy and prevent user confusion.

    <Warning>
      Avoid using multiple colored CTA buttons (e.g., primary and danger) in the same group to prevent "French flag syndrome" where no action is clearly prioritized.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use solid grey for secondary actions">
    Apply solid grey buttons for secondary CTAs that have lower emphasis than the primary action but are still important to the user flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reserve outline for lowest hierarchy">
    Use outline buttons for actions at the bottom of the hierarchy, such as "Previous" or "Cancel" buttons, and for hover/edit modes on grey backgrounds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Placement best practices

**Top-left placement**: Use for additive actions like "Add Item", "Create New", or "Import"

**Bottom-right placement**: Reserve for confirmatory actions such as "Save", "Submit", or "Continue"

<Tip>
  Consistent placement helps users develop muscle memory and improves the overall user experience.
</Tip>

### Labeling guidelines

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="✓ Clearly state the action" icon="check">
    Make sure that a button's label clearly states the outcome of the action. Use the same word or phrase as found elsewhere in the experience.

    **Good examples**: "Submit", "Save Changes", "Add Filter"
  </Card>
  <Card title="✓ Button hierarchy for clear and consistent labels" icon="check">
    When grouping buttons, ensure each button's label clearly describes a distinct action. Avoid duplicate labels in the same group.

    **Bad example**: Three buttons all labeled "Submit"
  </Card>
  <Card title="✓ Use icons only when necessary" icon="check">
    Icons can be used in buttons when additional clarity is required and the icon is highly relevant to the action. Icons should not be used for decoration.

    **Good example**: "+ Add Filter" (icon adds meaning)
  </Card>
  <Card title="✗ Don't override colors" icon="ban">
    Do not use custom colors for buttons. The colors of different button variations have been designed to be consistent and accessible.

    **Bad example**: Using a yellow button for a custom action type
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Writing effective button labels

- **Use clear, concise text** for describing an action
- **Keep it consistent** (e.g., match headlines with CTA wording)
- **Avoid redundancy** (e.g., "Add new" with a plus icon is superfluous)
- **Start with action verbs** like "Create", "Delete", "Submit", "Cancel"
- **Keep labels short** while maintaining clarity (1-3 words ideal)

## Best practices

<Check>
  **Do** limit primary CTAs to one per page or section to maintain clear hierarchy
</Check>

<Check>
  **Do** use action-oriented language that clearly describes what happens when clicked
</Check>

<Check>
  **Do** provide tooltips for icon-only buttons to ensure accessibility
</Check>

<Check>
  **Do** disable buttons when actions cannot be completed and provide context why
</Check>

<Warning>
  **Don't** place multiple primary-colored buttons in the same button group
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Don't** use decorative icons that don't add meaning to the action
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Don't** override button colors for custom styling—use the provided variants
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Don't** use vague labels like "Click here" or "OK" without context
</Warning>

## Accessibility considerations

- **Keyboard navigation**: Ensure all buttons are accessible via keyboard using Tab and Enter/Space keys
- **Focus indicators**: Maintain visible focus states for keyboard users
- **Touch targets**: Minimum touch target size should be 32x32px for mobile interfaces
- **Color contrast**: All button text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
- **Screen readers**: Provide aria-labels for icon-only buttons
- **Loading states**: Announce loading states to screen readers using aria-live regions

<Tip>
  Always test your button implementations with keyboard navigation and screen readers to ensure full accessibility.
</Tip>
